# GeoCheats
Mobile app that predict the country based on the camera image. For now I'm using a model from Google [1] to recognize European landmarks. Later, the plan is to get some big dataset of street view images and train that. If you're asking what is the use case, why not just GPS... Well, yeah, but I just wanted to learn the process of using a model and deploying it for a mobile app, you know, go through the motions. Besides, if you want to cheat at Geoguessr it might come in handy.
